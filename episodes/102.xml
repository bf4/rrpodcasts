Transcript
PETER:  Yeah, I've just come off a month of having a sore throat so you're very lucky to get me. It's literally in the last couple of days it seems to have gone back to normal which is good.

CHUCK:  Yeah. I could hear it in your newsletters.

PETER:  Exactly.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to Episode 100 of the Ruby Rogues podcast.

ALL:  Woohoo!

JAMES:  Wow!

CHUCK:  Yeah. We made it, somehow. This week on our panel, we have James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  If I sound like a zombie today, it’s because I am.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Hello from San Francisco!

CHUCK:  David Brady.

DAVID:  “Hello from Mount West Ruby Conf,” is what I would say if I had not skipped the first half of the first day of Mount West Ruby Conf to be here to record.

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello from Denver.

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.tv, also skipping Mount West Ruby Conference. We’re going to have a series of guests on for our 100th episode. Right now, we have Peter Cooper on the line.

PETER:  Good afternoon, full of Doctor Who fans.

[Laughter]

JAMES:  He’s lying!

DAVID:  Impostor! Impostor!

CHUCK:  [Laughs]

DAVID:  Exterminate!

JAMES:  He won't get that joke.

JOSH:  So, if you're not a Doctor Who fan, are you a fan of like Upstairs, Downstairs instead?

PETER:  I have stairs in my house.

JOSH:  Okay. That will work.

[Laughter]
