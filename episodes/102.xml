CHUCK: Hey everybody and welcome to episode 83 of the Ruby Rogues Podcast! This week on our panel, we have Josh Susser.

JOSH: Hey everyone!

CHUCK: David Brady.

DAVID: In the unlikely event of a water landing, your headphones can be used as a floatation device.

CHUCK: Avdi Grimm.

AVDI: Hey from Pennsylvania!

CHUCK: Katrina Owen.

KATRINA: Hello!

CHUCK: I'm Charles Max Wood from devchat.tv and this week, have a special guest – it’s Bryan Helmkamp.

BRYAN: Hi everyone!

DAVID: We are missing someone today.

CHUCK: Really?

JOSH: Yeah. Where is James?

AVDI: Haven’t seen him.

DAVID: James can’t be here today because he’s tutoring the pope in the scientific method.

CHUCK: All right.

JOSH: We’ll go with that.

DAVID: Yeah.

CHUCK: All right. So we have a couple of announcements before we get going. The first one I'm going to let Katrina give us the Best of Parley.
