1:15 JAMES: How the heck did we end up with this many Californians on one call? What happened?

1:19 DAVE: yeah some got outsourced.

1:22 CHUCK : I know it’s scary. And I’m Charles Max Wood from Teach me to Code.com. We also have 2 guest rogues. That is Jack Danger. What’s your last name Jack? I get stuck at Danger.

1:32 JACK: Sure. Sure. It’s “Canty”. It’s Irish for happy.

1:35 CHUCK: Oh Ok! And also…

1:36 DAVE: Your name is “Happy Danger”?

1:38 JAMES: That is amazing.

[Laughter]

1:39 JACK: “Jack Danger Happy” actually.

1:41 DAVID: Jack Danger Happy. That’s like, that’s like the Chinese ideogram for opportunity is crisis plus opportunity.

1:50 CHUCK: So I just want to know what the words in Irish are for sleepy, dopey, dark, bashful, sleazy? Who am I forgetting? Well, grumpy?

2:01 JACK: Well, grumpy is Zach. Dopey is Brock. So I think we’ve actually covered the next guest.

[Laughter]

2:08 CHUCK: That’s right we have another guest and that’s Zach Brock.

2:11 ZACH: Also from team San Francisco.

2:13 CHUCK: Yeah, they both work at Square and you guys can tell people what Square does and then introduce yourselves. That would be great.
