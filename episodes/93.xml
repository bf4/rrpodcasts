CHUCK:  Hey everybody, and welcome to Episode 91 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  Hello everyone.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Hey, good morning.

CHUCK:  David Brady.

DAVID:  Hello from the frozen tundra of Utah.

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello from the slushy not so much tundra of Oslo.

CHUCK:  I'm Charles Max Wood from DevChat.tv.

Before we get going too much, I did want to make a quick announcement on my own behalf. I'm going to be teaching a Ruby on Rails Course, in a couple, in like four weeks, in a month. It's going to start March 6th. I know not everybody is terribly interested in this because we have a lot of competent Rails developers. But I keep getting requests for coaching based on the podcasts. So, I just wanted to let the folks know who want to learn Rails from me that you can go sign up at RailsRampUp.com.

The in-person courses cost around $2000 and sometimes you have to travel to those. And what I'm providing is it’s an online thing. So, you don't have to pay for travel. The course is $1200, but if you put in the code ‘podcast’, you can get it for $1000. You get eight weeks basically of webinar-type training. So it’s in-person, well, not in-person. It’s online training. You get mentorship from me as much as you need, online forums, so you can collaborate with other people,</itunes:summary>
