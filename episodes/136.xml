Transcript
DAVID: Chuck we wanted to know, did Obi-Wan call and tell you to take the trash out?

JAMES: (That's awesome.)

CHUCK: Yes.

DAVID: That's got to be an abuse of the force.

CHUCK: (Oh man.)

DAVID: Imagine if Obi-Wan is a force ghost, just like, Luke feed my cat!

AVDI: Luke, can you read me peanuts from this latest paper.

JOSH: As a ghost I cannot turn the pages.

DAVID:  I am bored what you are doing?

CHUCK: Hey everybody. Welcome to episode 41 of the Ruby Rogues Podcast.  This week on our panel, we have against the rogue, its Bryan Helmkamp!

BRYAN: Hi guys.

CHUCK: Bryan, you want to introduce yourself?

BRYAN: Sure. So, very happy to be on the show today, my name is Bryan Helmkamp. I work on a number of things in the Ruby community. I’ve done some open source stuff. Most recently, I'm working on a called Code Climate (which we will talk about in a little bit). But I also help out in the New York Ruby community, organizing the NRCrb meet-ups and GoRuCo.

CHUCK: GoRuCo, not to be confused with go GoRuCo right?

BRYAN: Not to be confused with go GoRuCo. We had the name first, which I think Josh will admit to.

JOSH: (Sure.)

BRYAN: We authorized the licensing of the Go GoRuCo name.

DAVID: Is Go GoRuCo based basically the Lady Gaga of GoRuCo?

BRYAN: I think that's apt, yes.

CHUCK: All right, also in our panel we have Avdi Grimm.

AVDI: Good morning.

CHUCK: We also have David Brady.

DAVID: Estás usando este software de traducción de forma incorrecta. Por favor consulta el manual!

CHUCK: We also have James Edward Gray.

JAMES: Wait I am confused.

DAVID: I wanted to see how long it would go.

JOSH: David you do a great Steven *** (2:25) impersonation.

DAVID: Thank you.

CHUCK: And finally we have Josh Susser.</itunes:summary>
