CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to Episode 89 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Good morning, everyone!

CHUCK:  James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  I’m recording this episode from the Hot System.

CHUCK:  Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  I’m recording this episode from [Inaudible].

CHUCK:  And I’m Charles Max Wood from devchat.tv and I just got back from New Media Expo and CES.

JOSH:  Where was that?

CHUCK:  They were both in Vegas.

JOSH:  So can you actually tell us about what happened there or does everything that happens there, et cetera?

CHUCK:  [Laughs] Well, so New Media Expo, I was actually there speaking on Podcasting. They also had the Podcast Awards and we were nominated as one of the Technology Podcasts.

AVDI:  Thank you, everyone.

CHUCK:  And being nominated is kind of a big deal. So yeah, thank you everybody who nominated us.

JAMES:  I think we’re the only specific language Podcast in the entire Tech category. So, that was kind of crazy.

JOSH:  I think we were sort of the underdog.</itunes:summary>
