Transcript
CHUCK:  Okay, that’s just creepy, Dave.
DAVID:  Is it the eyeball picture?
CHUCK:  Yeah.
SARON:  Yeah, it’s really scary.
[Chuckles]
DAVID:  Completely by accident, the eyeball is perfectly centered so that when people are calling me or I’m ringing back to them, the Ajax spinner goes right around the pupil.
[Laughter]
CHUCK:  Completely by accident, huh?
SARON:  That’s [awful]. That makes it okay. Now I’m okay with it.
DAVID:  Yeah.
AVDI:  [Laughs]
CHUCK:  Because that’s not more creepy, right?
DAVID:  Exactly.
SARON:  It’s gone past the creepy level into awesome level. 
DAVID:  [Laughs] I can die happy.
