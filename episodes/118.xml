Transcript
JOSH: In driver’s ed they always told us to aim high in steering, so shooting for the horizon is usually the right thing to do.

[laughter]

DAVE: You either had the worst or the best driver’s ed class ever.

JOSH: They played us that great prom night video. It is called like “The Last Prom”, where the kids get drunk and then get in the car and drive to prom and they all die.

[laughter]

JAMES: So, is this driver’s ed or sex ed or what?

JOSH: It was driver’s ed.

DAVE: It was combined, you know.

[laughter]

CHUCK: (laughs) We have James Edward Gray.

JAMES: Why do you make me follow him? Come on.

JOSH: Hey everybody! It’s great to be back. I had a few weeks off to go deal with my start-up stuff and that went well and happy to be back on the show.

CHUCK: I'm Charles Max Wood from devchat.tv and this week, we have Jim Weirich!

JIM: Hello there! I'm just happy to be here.

CHUCK: Alright. Well we haven’t had you on for a while; do you want to do a brief introduction so people know who you are Jim?

JIM: Okay that's fine.

JOSH: Because nobody knows who Jim is.

CHUCK: Jim: define. Go ahead Jim sorry about that.

JIM: Oh, I'm sorry! You wanted me to introduce myself. I thought you guys were going to introduce me. Okay, so I'm Jim Weirich. I work for EdgeCase -- a New Context company. (We got to say the entire thing now since we have been bought). I've been in the Ruby world since like, forever. And just really love Ruby and love other technologies as well. Particularly interested in the topic today, the SOLID principles and have lots of opinions on that. So,</itunes:summary>
