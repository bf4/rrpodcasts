CHUCK:  Hey, everybody and welcome to Episode 95 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Hey, good morning from beautiful, sunny San Francisco.

CHUCK:  We also have Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Hello from Pennsylvania.

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello from Montreal.

CHUCK:  David Brady.

DAVID:  Montreal? You're in Denver!

KATRINA:  That was yesterday.

DAVID:  Hi from Salt Lake City.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from  HYPERLINK "http://www.DevChat.tv" DevChat.tv. And this week, we have a special guest. And that is Joe O’Brien.

JOE:  Hello and welcome from a not-so-sunny, not-so-beautiful flyover City of Ohio.

CHUCK:  So Joe, I know we all know who you are. But this is your first time on the show. Do you want to introduce yourself really quickly so people can get an idea of where you're at and who you are?

JOE:  Yeah. So, hello, I'm Joe O’Brien. I founded a company called EdgeCase, co-founded back in 2006, right about the start of the Rails boom. I got to speak at the first ever Rails, first two ever Rails conferences, depending on how you measure it and look at it. I was at both of them. And I have been enjoying it ever since. And I recently left the company. They're in great hands.</itunes:summary>
