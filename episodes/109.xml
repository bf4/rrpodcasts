Transcript
JOSH: The first time somebody recognized my voice from the podcast, he thought I was David Brady.

CHUCK: Oh really? [laughs]

JOSH: He’s like, “Oh my god! I know your voice from somewhere!” I'm like, “Do you listen to Ruby Rogues?” “Oh my god, you’re David Brady!”

CHUCK: [laughs] You have more hair than David. It comes across in your voice.

ELISE: Welcome to the first episode of bizarro Ruby Rogues; featuring Erin, Matt, Geoff and me – Elise Worthy. Where have your regular hosts gone? I have no idea. Erin, do you wanna go first?

ERIN:  Sure. [laughs] Hey everyone. My name is Erin Parker. I’ve been learning Ruby on Rails since August of last year. And I’m using it to build a site called Spitfire Athlete, which is a fitness network for women.

ELISE: Matt?

MATT: How are you doing? I’ve been using Ruby for about a year and a half. And I’m just working on a couple of personal projects right now -- or projects that I hope to release soon. And that’s about it.

ELISE: Geoffrey.

JOSH: Hi I’m Geoff Petrie. I’ve been working with Ruby for probably about 4-5 months now, but on and off for a few years. But this has been really the first time I've been diving further than just sort of a cursory look.

ELISE: Cool. And I’m Elise Worthy.</itunes:summary>
